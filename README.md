# Terraform GitHub Provider Example

This repository contains an example setup for managing GitHub resources using the Terraform GitHub provider. It is ideal for automating your GitHub configurations in a declarative manner.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your machine. [Download here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- A GitHub account. [Sign up here](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one; it's free.
- A personal access token (PAT) from GitHub with the necessary permissions. [Generate one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mixxor/terraform-github-provider-example.git
    cd terraform-github-provider-example
    ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**

    Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project, which will download the necessary provider plugins:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

    Set your GitHub token as an environment variable. Replace `your_github_token` with your actual GitHub token.

    ```bash
    export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
    ```

4. **Update Terraform Configuration**

    Edit the Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) to specify your GitHub organization or the resources you want to manage.

5. **Plan and Apply**

    Run a Terraform plan to see the changes that will be made:
